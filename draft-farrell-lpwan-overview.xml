	  <t>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
with 
characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly 
very small packet and
application layer data sizes and long battery life operation.  
This memo is an
informational overview of the set of LPWAN technologies being 
considered in the IETF and of the gaps that exist between the
needs of those technologies and the goal of running IP in LPWANs.

	  <t>Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is developed and standardized
by 3GPP.  The standardization of NB-IoT was finalized with 3GPP Release-13 in
June 2016, but further enhancements for NB-IoT are worked on in the following
releases, for example in the form of multicast support. For more information of
what has been specified for NB-IoT, 3GPP specification 36.300 <xref
target="TGPP36300"></xref> provides an overview and overall description of the
E-UTRAN radio interface protocol architecture, while specifications 36.321
<xref target="TGPP36321"></xref>, 36.322 <xref target="TGPP36322"></xref>,
36.323 <xref target="TGPP36323"></xref> and 36.331 <xref
target="TGPP36331"></xref> give  more detailed description of MAC, RLC, PDCP
and RRC protocol layers respectively. The new versions of the specifications
including NB-IoT are not yet available due to novelty of the feature, but
should be shortly available in the 3GPP website.</t> 

	  </section>

	  <section anchor="nbiot-chars" title="Characteristics">

<t>[[Editor notes: Not clear if all the radio info here is needed. Not
clear what MTUs might be. Many 3GPP acronyms/terms to eliminate or
explain.]]</t>

<t>
Specific targets for NB-IoT include: Less than 5$ module cost, extended
coverage of 164 dB maximum coupling loss, battery life of over 10 years, ~55000
devices per cell and uplink reporting latency of less than 10 seconds.</t>

<t>NB-IoT supports Half Duplex FDD operation mode with 60 kbps peak rate in
uplink and 30 kbps peak rate in downlink. 
As the name suggests, NB-IoT uses narrowbands with
the bandwidth of 180 kHz in both, downlink and uplink. The multiple access
scheme used in the downlink is OFDMA with 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing. On uplink
multi-tone SC-FDMA is used with 15 kHz tone spacing or as a special case of
SC-FDMA single tone with either 15kHz or 3.75 kHz tone spacing may be used.
</t>

<t>NB-IoT can be deployed in three ways. In-band deployment means that the
narrowband is multiplexed within normal LTE carrier. In Guard-band deployment
the narrowband uses the unused resource blocks between two adjacent LTE
carriers. Also standalone deployment is supported, where the narrowband can be
located alone in dedicated spectrum, which makes it possible for example to
refarm the GSM carrier at 850/900 MHz for NB-IoT. All three deployment modes
are meant to be used in licensed bands. The maximum transmission power is
either 20 or 23 dBm for uplink transmissions, while for downlink transmission
the eNodeB may use higher transmission power, up to 46 dBm depending on the
deployment.</t>

<t>For signaling optimization, two options are introduced in addition to legacy
RRC connection setup, mandatory Data-over-NAS (Control Plane optimization,
solution 2 in <xref target="TGPP23720"></xref>) and optional RRC Suspend/Resume
(User Plane optimization, solution 18 in <xref target="TGPP23720"></xref>). In
the control plane optimization the data is sent over Non Access Stratum,
directly from Mobility Management Entity (MME) in core network to the UE
without interaction from base station. This means there are no Access Stratum
security or header compression, as the Access Stratum is bypassed, and only
limited RRC procedures.</t> <t>The RRC Suspend/Resume procedures reduce the
signaling overhead required for UE state transition from Idle to Connected mode
in order to have a user plane transaction with the network and back to Idle
state by reducing the signaling messages required compared to legacy
operation</t>

<t>With extended DRX the RRC Connected mode DRX cycle is up to 10.24 seconds
and in RRC Idle the DRX cycle can be up to 3 hours.</t>

<t>NB-IoT has no channel access restrictions allowing up to a 100% duty-cycle.</t>

<t>3GPP access security is specified in <xref target="TGPP33203"></xref>.</t>

  <t>Mobility Management Entity (MME) is responsible for handling the mobility
of the UE. MME tasks include tracking and paging UEs, session management,
choosing the Serving gateway for the UE during initial attachment and
authenticating the user. At MME, the Non Access Stratum (NAS) signaling from
the UE is terminated.</t>

  <t>Serving Gateway (S-GW) routes and forwards the user data packets through
the access network and acts as a mobility anchor for UEs during handover
between base stations known as eNodeBs and also during handovers between other
3GPP technologies.</t>

  <t>Packet Data Node Gateway (P-GW) works as an interface between 3GPP network
and external networks.</t>

  <t>Home Subscriber Server (HSS) contains user-related and
subscription-related information. It is a database, which performs mobility
management, session establishment support, user authentication and access
authorization.</t>

  <t>E-UTRAN consists of components of a single type, eNodeB. eNodeB is a base
station, which controls the UEs in one or several cells.</t>

  <t>The radio protocol architecture of NB-IoT (and LTE) is separated into
control plane and user plane. Control plane consists of protocols which control
the radio access bearers and the connection between the UE and the network. The
highest layer of control plane is called Non-Access Stratum (NAS), which
conveys the radio signaling between the UE and the EPC, passing transparently
through radio network. It is responsible for authentication, security control,
mobility management and bearer management.</t>

  <t>Access Stratum (AS) is the functional layer below NAS, and in control
plane it consists of Radio Resource Control protocol (RRC) <xref
target="TGPP36331"></xref>, which handles connection establishment and release
functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer establishment,
reconfiguration and release. RRC configures the user and control planes
according to the network status. There exists two RRC states, RRC_Idle or
RRC_Connected, and RRC entity controls the switching between these states. In
RRC_Idle, the network knows that the UE is present in the network and the UE
can be reached in case of incoming call. In this state the UE monitors paging,
performs cell measurements and cell selection and acquires system information.
Also the UE can receive broadcast and multicast data, but it is not expected to
transmit or receive singlecast data. In RRC_Connected the UE has a connection
to the eNodeB, the network knows the UE location on cell level and the UE may
receive and transmit singlecast data. RRC_Connected mode is established, when
the UE is expected to be active in the network, to transmit or receive data.
Connection is released, switching to RRC_Idle, when there is no traffic to save
the UE battery and radio resources. However, a new feature was introduced for
NB-IoT, as mentioned earlier, which allows data to be transmitted from the MME
directly to the UE, while the UE is in RRC_Idle transparently to the
eNodeB.</t>

  <t>Packet Data Convergence Protocol's (PDCP) <xref target="TGPP36323"></xref>
main services in control plane are transfer of control plane data, ciphering
and integrity protection. </t>

  <t>Radio Link Control protocol (RLC) <xref target="TGPP36322"></xref>
performs transfer of upper layer PDUs and optionally error correction with
Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), concatenation, segmentation and reassembly of
RLC SDUs, in-sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs, duplicate detection, RLC
SDU discard, RLC-re-establishment and protocol error detection and recovery.
</t>

  <t>Medium Access Control protocol (MAC) <xref target="TGPP36321"></xref>
provides mapping between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing
of MAC SDUs, scheduling information reporting, error correction with HARQ,
priority handling and transport format selection. </t>

  <t>Physical layer <xref target="TGPP36201"></xref> provides data transport
services to higher layers. These include error detection and indication to
higher layers, FEC encoding, HARQ soft-combining. Rate matching and mapping of
the transport channels onto physical channels, power weighting and modulation
of physical channels, frequency and time synchronization and radio
characteristics measurements.</t>

  <t>User plane is responsible for transferring the user data through the
Access Stratum. It interfaces with IP and consists of PDCP, which in user plane
performs header compression using Robust Header Compression (RoHC), transfer of
user plane data between eNodeB and UE, ciphering and integrity protection.
Lower layers in user plane are similarly RLC, MAC and physical layer performing
tasks mentioned above.</t>

<t>Under worst-case conditions, NB-IoT may achieve data rate of roughly 200
bps.  For downlink with 164 dB coupling loss, NB-IoT may achieve higher data
rates, depending on the deployment mode. Stand-alone operation may achieve the
highest data rates, up to few kbps, while in-band and guard-band operations may
reach several hundreds of bps. NB-IoT may even operate with higher maximum
coupling loss than 170 dB with very low bit rates.</t>

<t> The SIGFOX LPWAN is in line with the terminology and specifications being
defined by the ETSI ERM TG28 Low Throughput Networks (LTN) group <xref

<t>The SIGFOX LTN radio interface is also compliant with the local
regulations of the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Kenya,
Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Peru, Singapore, South Africa,
South Korea, and Thailand.</t>

<t> The radio interface is based on Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) communications,
which allow an increased transmission range by spending a limited amount of
energy at the device. Moreover, UNB allows a large number of devices to coexist
in a given cell without significantly increasing the spectrum interference.
</t>

<t>Both uplink and downlink communications are possible with the UNB solution.
Due to spectrum optimizations, different uplink and downlink frames and time
synchronization methods are needed.</t>

<t>The main radio characteristics of the UNB uplink transmission are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
			  
  <t>Channelization mask: 100 Hz (600 Hz in the USA)</t>

  <t>Uplink baud rate: 100 baud (600 baud in the USA)</t>

  <t>Modulation scheme: DBPSK</t>

  <t>Uplink transmission power: compliant with local regulation</t>

  <t>Link budget: 155 dB (or better)</t>

  <t>Central frequency accuracy: not relevant, provided there is no significant
frequency drift within an uplink packet</t>

</list></t>
			  
<t>In Europe, the UNB uplink frequency band is limited to 868,00 to 868,60 MHz,
with a maximum output power of 25 mW and a maximum mean transmission time of
1%.  </t>


<t>The format of the uplink frame is the following:</t>

  <t>Downlink baud rate: 600 baud</t>
  <t>Modulation scheme: GFSK</t>

</list></t>

<t>In Europe, the UNB downlink frequency band is limited to 869,40 to 869,65
MHz, with a maximum output power of 500 mW  with 10% duty cycle.  </t>

<t> The format of the downlink frame is the following:</t>

</list></t>

<t> The radio interface is optimized for uplink transmissions, which are
asynchronous. Downlink communications are achieved by querying the network for
existing data from the device.  </t>

<t> A device willing to receive downlink messages opens a fixed window for
reception after sending an uplink transmission.  The delay and duration of this
window have fixed values. The LTN network transmits the downlink message for a
given device during the reception window. The LTN network selects the BS for
transmitting the corresponding downlink message.  </t>

<t> Uplink and downlink transmissions are unbalanced due to the regulatory
constraints on the ISM bands. Under the strictest regulations, the system can
allow a maximum of 140 uplink messages and 4 downlink messages per device.
These restrictions can be slightly relaxed depending on system conditions and
the specific regulatory domain of operation. </t>

<t> The architecture consists of a single core network, which allows global
connectivity with minimal impact on the end device and radio access network.
The core network elements are the Service Center (SC) and the Registration
Authority (RA). The SC is in charge of the data connectivity between the Base
Station (BS) and the Internet, as well as the control and management of the BSs
and End Points.  The RA is in charge of the End Point network access
authorization.</t>

<t> The radio access network is comprised of several BSs connected directly to
the SC. Each BS performs complex L1/L2 functions, leaving some L2 and L3
functionalities to the SC.</t>

<t> The devices or End Points (EPs) are the objects that communicate
application data between local device applications (DAs) and network
applications (NAs).</t>

<t> EPs (or devices) can be static or nomadic, as they associate with the SC
and they do not attach to a specific BS. Hence, they can communicate with the
SC through one or many BSs.</t>

<t> Due to constraints in the complexity of the EP, it is assumed that EPs host
only one or very few device applications, which communicate to one single
network application at a time.</t>     

<t> The radio protocol provides mechanisms to authenticate and ensure integrity
of the message. This is achieved by using a unique device ID and a message
authentication code, which allow ensuring that the message has been generated
and sent by the device with the ID claimed in the message. </t>

<t> Security keys are independent for each device. These keys are associated
with the device ID and they are pre-provisioned. Application data can be
encrypted by the application provider.  </t>
