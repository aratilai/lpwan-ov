   <abstract>

	  <t>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
with 
characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly 
very small packet and
application layer data sizes and long battery life operation.  
This memo is an
informational overview of the set of LPWAN technologies being 
considered in the IETF and of the gaps that exist between the
needs of those technologies and the goal of running IP in LPWANs.

   <section title="Introduction">

	<t>[[Editor comments/queries are in double square
brackets like this.]]</t>

	<t>This document provides background material and an overview of
the technologies being considered in the IETF's Low Power Wide-Area
Networking (LPWAN) working group. We also provide a gap analysis
between the needs of these technologies and currently available 
IETF specifications.</t>

	<t>This document is largely the work of the
people listed in <xref target="contribs"/>. Discussion of this
document should take place on the lpwan@ietf.org list.</t>

	<t>[[Editor's note: the eventual fate of this draft is a
topic for the WG to consider - it might end up as a useful
RFC, or it might be best maintained as a draft only until its
utility has dissapated. FWIW, the editor doesn't mind what
outcome the WG choose.]]</t>

   </section>

	<section anchor="terms" title="Terminology">

	  <t> [[Not sure if 2119 terms will be needed. Leave it here for now.]] The key
words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.  </t> 

	<t>[[Extract common terms here. Maybe define and relate
technology specific terms, e.g. lora g/w similar to sigfox bs etc. There
is text for this in the current "gaps" draft.]]</t>
	

	</section>

	<section anchor="concerns" title="Common Concerns">

	<t>[[Editors note: We may want a section like this that describes some cross-cutting
issues, e.g. duty-cycles, some of the ISM band restrictions. This isn't intended
to be a problem statement nor a set of requirements but just to describe some 
issues that affect more than one of the LPWAN technologies.
Such a section might be better before or after <xref target="inputs"/>, will 
see when text's added there. There
is some text for this in the current "gaps" draft.]]</t>

	</section>


	<section anchor="inputs" title="LPWAN Technologies">

	<t>This section provides an overview of the set of LPWAN technologies
that are being considered in the LPWAN working group. The text for
each was mainly contributed by the proponents of each technology.</t>

<t>Note that this text is not intended to be normative in any sesne, but
simply to help the reader in finding the relevant layer 2 specifications
and in understanding how those integrate with IETF-defined technologies.
Similarly, there is no attempt here to set out the pros and cons of the
relevant technologies. [[Editor: I assume that's the right target here.
Please comment if you disagree.]]
</t>

	<t>[[Editor's note: the goal here is 2-3 pages per technology. If
there's much more needed then we could add appendices I guess depending
on what text the WG find useful to include.]]</t>
