	  <t>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
with 
characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly 
very small packet and
application layer data sizes and long battery life operation.  
This memo is an
informational overview of the set of LPWAN technologies being 
considered in the IETF and of the gaps that exist between the
needs of those technologies and the goal of running IP in LPWANs.

<t>In LoRaWAN networks, end-device transmissions may be received at multiple
gateways, so during nominal operation a network server may see multiple
instances of the same uplink message from an end-device.</t>

<t>To maximize both battery life of end-devices and overall network capacity,
the LoRaWAN network infrastructure manages the data rate and RF output power
for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR)
scheme.  End-devices may transmit on any channel allowed by local regulation at
any time, using any of the currently available data rates.  </t>

<t> LoRaWAN networks are typically organized in a star-of-stars topology in
which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central "network
server" in the backend.  Gateways are connected to the network server via IP
links while end-devices use single-hop LoRaWAN communication that can be
received at one or more gateways.  All communication is generally
bi-directional, although uplink communication from end-devices to the network
server are favoured in terms of overall bandwidth availability.  </t>

	<t>This section introduces some LoRaWAN terms.

<t><list style="symbols">

	<t>End-device: a LoRa client device, sometimes called a mote. Communicates with gateways.</t>

	<t>Gateway: a radio on the infrastructure-side, sometimes called a concentrator or base-station.
	Communicates with end-devices and, via the Internet, with a network server. </t>

	<t>Network Server: The Network Server (NS) terminates the LoRaWAN MAC layer
for the end-devices connected to the network. It is the center of the star
topology.
</t>

	<t>Uplink message: refers to communications from end-device to network server via one or
more gateways. </t>

	<t>Downlink message: refers to communications from network server via one gateway to a single
end-device or a group of end-devices (considering multicasting). </t>

	<t>Application: refers to application layer code both on the end-device
and running "behind" the network server. For LoRaWAN, there will generally 
only be one application running on most end-devices. Interfaces between
the network server and application are not further described here.</t>

<t>
Classes A, B and C define different device capabilities and modes
of operation for end-devices. End-devices can transmit uplink
messages at any time in any mode of operation (so long as e.g., ISM band
restrictions are honoured). An end-device in Class
A can only receive downlink messages at predetermined timeslots after
each uplink message transmission. Class B allows the end-device to
receive downlink messages at periodically scheduled timeslots. Class C
allows receipt of downlink messages at anytime. Class selection is
based on the end-devices' application use case and its power supply.
(While Classes B and C are not further described here, readers may have seen
those terms elsewhere so we include them for clarity.)
</t>


</list></t>

	<t>LoRaWAN radios make use of ISM bands, for example, 433MHz and 868MHz
within the European Union and 915MHz in the Americas.</t>

	<t>The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every
transmission to help make the system more robust to interference and/or to
conform to local regulations.</t>

	<t>As with other LPWAN radio technologies, LoRaWAN end-devices respect the
frequency, power and maximum transmit duty cycle requirements for the sub-band
imposed by local regulators. In most cases, this means an end-device is only
transmitting for 1% of the time, as specified by ISM band regulations. And in
some cases the LoRaWAN specification calls for end-devices to transmit less
often than is called for by the ISM band regulations in order to avoid
congestion.  </t>

      <t>
       <xref target="lora-trans"/> below shows that after a transmission slot a Class A device
turns on its receiver for two short receive windows that are offset from
the end of the transmission window. The frequencies and data rate chosen
for the first of these receive windows depends on those used for the transmit window.
The frequency and data-rate for the second receive window are configurable.
If a downlink message preamble is detected during a receive window, then
the end-device keeps the radio on in order to receive the frame.
</t>

<t>End-devices can only transmit a subsequent uplink frame after the end
of the associated receive windows. When a device joins a LoRaWAN
network, there are similar timeouts on parts of that process.
</t>

	<t>Given the different regional requirements the detailed specification for the
LoRaWAN physical layer (taking up more than 30 pages of
the specification) is not reproduced here.  Instead
and mainly to illustrate the kinds of issue encountered, in 
<xref target="lora-ism868"/> we present some of the default settings for one
ISM band (without fully explaining those here) and in <xref target="lora-minmax"/>
we describe maxima and
minima for some parameters of interest to those defining ways to use IETF
protocols over the LoRaWAN MAC layer.</t>

</texttable>

<t>Note that in the case of the smallest frame size (19 octets), 
8 octets are required for LoRa MAC layer headers leaving only
11 octets for payload (including MAC layer options). However, those
settings do not apply for the join procedure - end-devices are
required to use a channel that can send the 23 byte Join-request
message for the 
join procedure.</t>

	<t>Uplink and downlink higher layer data is carried in a MACPayload.  There
is a concept of "ports" (an optional 8 bit value) to handle different
applications on an end-device. Port zero is reserved for LoRaWAN specific
messaging, such as the join procedure.</t> 

<t>The header also distinguishes the uplink/downlink
directions and whether or not an acknowledgement ("confirmation") is required
from the peer.</t>

	<t>All payloads are encrypted  
and ciphertexts are protected with a cryptographic
Message Integrity Check (MIC) 
- see <xref target="sec-cons"/> for details.</t>

<t>In addition to carrying higher layer PDUs
there are Join-Request and Join-Response (aka Join-Accept) messages for handling 
network access. And so-called "MAC commands" (see below) up to 15 bytes long can be 
piggybacked in an options field ("FOpts").</t>


	<t>LoRaWAN end-devices can choose various different data rates from a menu
of available rates (dependent on the frequencies in use). It is however, 
recommended that end-devices set the Adaptive Data Rate ("ADR") bit
in the MAC layer which is a signal that the network should control the
data rate (via MAC commands to the end-device). 
The network can also assert the ADR bit and control data rates at it's
discretion.
The goal is to ensure
minimal on-time for radios whilst increasing throughput and reliability when possible.
Other things being equal, the effect should be that end-devices closer to a 
gateway can successfully use higher data rates, whereas end-devices
further from all gateways still receive connectivity though at a lower
data rate.
</t>

	<t>Data rate changes can be validated via a scheme of acks from
the network with a fall-back to lower rates in the event that 
downlink acks go missing.</t>

	<t>There are 16 (or 32) bit frame counters maintained in each direction
that are incremented on each transmission (but not re-transmissions)
that are not re-used for a given key. When the device supports a 32 bit counter, then
only the least significant 16 bits are sent in the MAC header, but
all 32 bits are used in cryptographic operations. (If an end-device
only supports a 16 bit counter internally, then the topmost 16 bits
are set to zero.)</t>

	<t>There are a number of MAC commands for:
	Link and device status checking, ADR and duty-cycle negotiation,
managing the RX windows and radio channel settings. For example,
the link check response message allows the network server (in
response to a request from an end-device) to
inform an end-device about the signal attenuation seen most
recently at a gateway, and to also tell the end-device how
many gateways received the corresponding link request MAC
command.</t>

<t>Some MAC commands are initiated by the network server.
For example, one command allows the network server
to ask an end-device to reduce it's duty-cycle to only
use a proportion of the maximum allowed in a region. 
Another allows the network server to query the
end-device's power status with the response from
the end-device specifying whether it has an external power 
source or is battery powered (in which case a relative
battery level is also sent to the network server).</t>
	
	<t>The network server can also inform an end-device
about channel assignments (mid-point frequencies and data
rates). Of course, these must also remain within the
bands assigned by local regulation.</t>

	<t>A LoRaWAN network has a short network identifier ("NwkID") which is a 
seven bit value.  A private network (common for LoRaWAN) can use the value 
zero. If
a network wishes to support "foreign" end-devices then the NwkID
needs to be registered with the LoRA Alliance, in which case the
NwkID is the seven least significant bits of a registered 24-bit
NetID. (Note however, that
the methods for "roaming" are currently being enhanced
within the LoRA Alliance, so the situation here is somewhat fluid.)</t>

	<t>In order to operate nominally on a LoRaWAN network, a device needs a 
32-bit device address, which is the catentation of the NwkID and a
25-bit device-specific network address that is assigned when the
device "joins" the network (see below for the join procedure) or
that is pre-provisioned into the device.</t>


	<t>End-devices are assumed to work with one or a quite limited 
number of applications, which matches most LoRaWAN use-cases. The
applications are identified by a 64-bit AppEUI, which is assumed
to be a registered IEEE EUI64 value.</t>

	<t>In addition, a device needs to have two symmetric session
keys, one for protecting network artefacts (port=0), the NwkSKey,
and another for protecting appliction layer traffic, the 
AppSKey. Both keys are used for 128 bit AES cryptpgraphic
operations. (See <xref target="sec-cons"/> for details.)</t>

	<t>So, one option is for an end-device to have all of the above,
plus channel information, 
somehow (pre-)provisioned, in which case the end-device can
simply start transmitting. This is achievable in many cases via
out-of-band means given the nature of LoRaWAN networks.
<xref target="table-nominal"/> summarises these values.
</t>

<texttable anchor="table-nominal" title="Values required for nominal operation">

<c>AppSKey </c> <c> 128 bit application session key for use with AES</c> 
</texttable>

	<t>As an alternative, end-devices can use the LoRaWAN
join procedure in order to setup some
of these values and dynamically gain access to the network.</t>

	<t>To use the join procedure, an end-device must still
know the AppEUI.
	In addition to the AppEUI, end-devices using the join procedure
need to also know a different (long-term) symmetric key  that
is bound to the AppEUI - this is the application key (AppKey),
and is distinct from the application session key (AppSKey). The
AppKey is required to be specific to the device, that is, 
each end-device should have a different AppKey value. And
finally the end-device also needs a long-term identifier for
itself, syntactically also an EUI-64, and known as the 
device EUI or DevEUI. <xref target="table-join"/> summarises
these values.</t> 

<texttable anchor="table-join" title="Values required for join procedure">
    <ttcol align='left'>Value</ttcol>
    <ttcol align='left'>Description</ttcol>
<c>DevEUI </c> <c> IEEE EUI64 naming the device</c>
<c>AppEUI </c> <c> IEEE EUI64 naming the application</c>
<c>AppKey </c> <c> 128 bit long term application key for use with AES</c> 
</texttable>

	<t>The join procedure involves a special exchange where
the end-device asserts the AppEUI and DevEUI (integrity 
protected with the long-term AppKey, but not encrypted) in a Join-request
uplink message. This 
is then routed to the network server which interacts with
an entity that knows that AppKey to verify the Join-request.
All going well, a Join-accept downlink message is returned
from the network server to the end-device that specifies the 24-bit NetID, 32-bit
DevAddr
and channel information and from which the AppSKey and
NwkSKey can be derived based on knowledge of the AppKey.
This provides the end-device with all the values listed
in <xref target="table-nominal"/>.</t>

	<t>There is some special handling related to which channels 
to use and for multiple transmissions for the join-request which
is intended to ensure a successful join in as many cases as
possible. Join-request and Join-accept messages also include
some random values (nonces) to both provide some replay 
protection and to help ensure the session keys are unique
per run of the join procedure. If a Join-request fails validation, then no Join-accept
message (indeed no message at all) is returned to the end-device.
For example, if an end-device is factory-reset then it should end up in a
state in which it can re-do the join procedure. </t>

	<t>In this section we describe the use of cryptography in LoRaWAN.
This section is not intended as a
full specification but to be sufficient so
that future IETF specifications can encompass the required
security considerations. The emphasis is on describing the
externally visible characteristics of LoRaWAN.</t>


	<t>All payloads are encrypted and have data integrity. Frame options
(used for MAC commands) when sent as a payload (port zero) are therefore 
protected. MAC commands piggy-backed as frame options ("FOpts") are
however sent in clear.
	Since MAC commands may be sent as options and not
only as payload, any values sent in that manner are visible to a passive
attacker but are not malleable for an active attacker
due to the use of the MIC.</t>

	<t>For LoRaWAN version 1.0.x, the NWkSkey session key is used
to provide data integrity between the end-device and the network
server. The AppSKey is used to provide data confidentiality between
the end-device and network server, or to the application "behind"
the network server, depending on the implementation of the 
network. </t>

	<t>All MAC layer messages have an outer 32-bit Message Integrity Code (MIC)
calculated using AES-CMAC calculated over the ciphertext payload and other
headers and using the NwkSkey.</t>

	<t>Payloads are encrypted using 
AES-128, with a counter-mode derived from IEEE 802.15.4 using the
AppSKey.</t>

	<t>Gateways are not expected to be provided with the AppSKey or NwkSKey,
all of the infrastructure-side cryptography happens in (or "behind") the
network server. </t>

	<t>When session keys are derived from the AppKey as a result of
the join procedure the Join-accept message payload is specially
handled.</t> 

<t>The long-term AppKey is directly used to protect
the Join-accept message content, but the function used is not
an aes-encrypt operation, but rather an
aes-decrypt operation. The justification is that this means
that the end-device only needs to implement the aes-encrypt
operation. (The counter 
mode variant used for payload decryption means the end-device
doesn't need an aes-decrypt primitive.)</t>

	<t>The Join-accept plaintext is always less than 
16 bytes long, so electronic code book (ECB) mode is used
for protecting Join-accept messages.</t>

	<t>The Join-accept contains an AppNonce (a 
24 bit value) that is recovered on the end-device along
with the other Join-accept content (e.g. DevAddr) using
the aes-encrypt operation.</t> 

	<t>Once the Join-accept payload is available to
the end-device the session keys are derived from the
AppKey, AppNonce and other values, again using an
ECB mode aes-encrypt operation, with
the plaintext input being a maximum of 16 octets.</t>

<t>[[Editor notes: Not clear if all the radio info here is needed. Not
clear what MTUs might be. Many 3GPP acronyms/terms to eliminate or
explain.]]</t>

<t>
Specific targets for NB-IoT include: Less than 5$ module cost, extended
coverage of 164 dB maximum coupling loss, battery life of over 10 years, ~55000
devices per cell and uplink reporting latency of less than 10 seconds.</t>

<t>NB-IoT supports Half Duplex FDD operation mode with 60 kbps peak rate in
uplink and 30 kbps peak rate in downlink. 
As the name suggests, NB-IoT uses narrowbands with
the bandwidth of 180 kHz in both, downlink and uplink. The multiple access
scheme used in the downlink is OFDMA with 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing. On uplink
multi-tone SC-FDMA is used with 15 kHz tone spacing or as a special case of
SC-FDMA single tone with either 15kHz or 3.75 kHz tone spacing may be used.
</t>

<t>NB-IoT can be deployed in three ways. In-band deployment means that the
narrowband is multiplexed within normal LTE carrier. In Guard-band deployment
the narrowband uses the unused resource blocks between two adjacent LTE
carriers. Also standalone deployment is supported, where the narrowband can be
located alone in dedicated spectrum, which makes it possible for example to
refarm the GSM carrier at 850/900 MHz for NB-IoT. All three deployment modes
are meant to be used in licensed bands. The maximum transmission power is
either 20 or 23 dBm for uplink transmissions, while for downlink transmission
the eNodeB may use higher transmission power, up to 46 dBm depending on the
deployment.</t>

<t>For signaling optimization, two options are introduced in addition to legacy
RRC connection setup, mandatory Data-over-NAS (Control Plane optimization,
solution 2 in <xref target="TGPP23720"></xref>) and optional RRC Suspend/Resume
(User Plane optimization, solution 18 in <xref target="TGPP23720"></xref>). In
the control plane optimization the data is sent over Non Access Stratum,
directly from Mobility Management Entity (MME) in core network to the UE
without interaction from base station. This means there are no Access Stratum
security or header compression, as the Access Stratum is bypassed, and only
limited RRC procedures.</t> <t>The RRC Suspend/Resume procedures reduce the
signaling overhead required for UE state transition from Idle to Connected mode
in order to have a user plane transaction with the network and back to Idle
state by reducing the signaling messages required compared to legacy
operation</t>

<t>With extended DRX the RRC Connected mode DRX cycle is up to 10.24 seconds
and in RRC Idle the DRX cycle can be up to 3 hours.</t>

<t>NB-IoT has no channel access restrictions allowing up to a 100% duty-cycle.</t>

<t>3GPP access security is specified in <xref target="TGPP33203"></xref>.</t>

  <t>Mobility Management Entity (MME) is responsible for handling the mobility
of the UE. MME tasks include tracking and paging UEs, session management,
choosing the Serving gateway for the UE during initial attachment and
authenticating the user. At MME, the Non Access Stratum (NAS) signaling from
the UE is terminated.</t>

  <t>Serving Gateway (S-GW) routes and forwards the user data packets through
the access network and acts as a mobility anchor for UEs during handover
between base stations known as eNodeBs and also during handovers between other
3GPP technologies.</t>

  <t>Packet Data Node Gateway (P-GW) works as an interface between 3GPP network
and external networks.</t>

  <t>Home Subscriber Server (HSS) contains user-related and
subscription-related information. It is a database, which performs mobility
management, session establishment support, user authentication and access
authorization.</t>

  <t>E-UTRAN consists of components of a single type, eNodeB. eNodeB is a base
station, which controls the UEs in one or several cells.</t>

  <t>The radio protocol architecture of NB-IoT (and LTE) is separated into
control plane and user plane. Control plane consists of protocols which control
the radio access bearers and the connection between the UE and the network. The
highest layer of control plane is called Non-Access Stratum (NAS), which
conveys the radio signaling between the UE and the EPC, passing transparently
through radio network. It is responsible for authentication, security control,
mobility management and bearer management.</t>

  <t>Access Stratum (AS) is the functional layer below NAS, and in control
plane it consists of Radio Resource Control protocol (RRC) <xref
target="TGPP36331"></xref>, which handles connection establishment and release
functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer establishment,
reconfiguration and release. RRC configures the user and control planes
according to the network status. There exists two RRC states, RRC_Idle or
RRC_Connected, and RRC entity controls the switching between these states. In
RRC_Idle, the network knows that the UE is present in the network and the UE
can be reached in case of incoming call. In this state the UE monitors paging,
performs cell measurements and cell selection and acquires system information.
Also the UE can receive broadcast and multicast data, but it is not expected to
transmit or receive singlecast data. In RRC_Connected the UE has a connection
to the eNodeB, the network knows the UE location on cell level and the UE may
receive and transmit singlecast data. RRC_Connected mode is established, when
the UE is expected to be active in the network, to transmit or receive data.
Connection is released, switching to RRC_Idle, when there is no traffic to save
the UE battery and radio resources. However, a new feature was introduced for
NB-IoT, as mentioned earlier, which allows data to be transmitted from the MME
directly to the UE, while the UE is in RRC_Idle transparently to the
eNodeB.</t>

  <t>Packet Data Convergence Protocol's (PDCP) <xref target="TGPP36323"></xref>
main services in control plane are transfer of control plane data, ciphering
and integrity protection. </t>

  <t>Radio Link Control protocol (RLC) <xref target="TGPP36322"></xref>
performs transfer of upper layer PDUs and optionally error correction with
Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), concatenation, segmentation and reassembly of
RLC SDUs, in-sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs, duplicate detection, RLC
SDU discard, RLC-re-establishment and protocol error detection and recovery.
</t>

  <t>Medium Access Control protocol (MAC) <xref target="TGPP36321"></xref>
provides mapping between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing
of MAC SDUs, scheduling information reporting, error correction with HARQ,
priority handling and transport format selection. </t>

  <t>Physical layer <xref target="TGPP36201"></xref> provides data transport
services to higher layers. These include error detection and indication to
higher layers, FEC encoding, HARQ soft-combining. Rate matching and mapping of
the transport channels onto physical channels, power weighting and modulation
of physical channels, frequency and time synchronization and radio
characteristics measurements.</t>

  <t>User plane is responsible for transferring the user data through the
Access Stratum. It interfaces with IP and consists of PDCP, which in user plane
performs header compression using Robust Header Compression (RoHC), transfer of
user plane data between eNodeB and UE, ciphering and integrity protection.
Lower layers in user plane are similarly RLC, MAC and physical layer performing
tasks mentioned above.</t>

<t>Under worst-case conditions, NB-IoT may achieve data rate of roughly 200
bps.  For downlink with 164 dB coupling loss, NB-IoT may achieve higher data
rates, depending on the deployment mode. Stand-alone operation may achieve the
highest data rates, up to few kbps, while in-band and guard-band operations may
reach several hundreds of bps. NB-IoT may even operate with higher maximum
coupling loss than 170 dB with very low bit rates.</t>

<t> The SIGFOX LPWAN is in line with the terminology and specifications being
defined by the ETSI ERM TG28 Low Throughput Networks (LTN) group <xref

<t>The radio interface is compliant with the following regulations:</t>

<t>The SIGFOX LTN radio interface is also compliant with the local
regulations of the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Kenya,
Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Peru, Singapore, South Africa,
South Korea, and Thailand.</t>

<t> The radio interface is based on Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) communications,
which allow an increased transmission range by spending a limited amount of
energy at the device. Moreover, UNB allows a large number of devices to coexist
in a given cell without significantly increasing the spectrum interference.
</t>

<t>Both uplink and downlink communications are possible with the UNB solution.
Due to spectrum optimizations, different uplink and downlink frames and time
synchronization methods are needed.</t>

<t>The main radio characteristics of the UNB uplink transmission are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
			  
  <t>Channelization mask: 100 Hz (600 Hz in the USA)</t>

  <t>Uplink baud rate: 100 baud (600 baud in the USA)</t>

  <t>Modulation scheme: DBPSK</t>

  <t>Uplink transmission power: compliant with local regulation</t>

  <t>Link budget: 155 dB (or better)</t>

  <t>Central frequency accuracy: not relevant, provided there is no significant
frequency drift within an uplink packet</t>

</list></t>
			  
<t>In Europe, the UNB uplink frequency band is limited to 868,00 to 868,60 MHz,
with a maximum output power of 25 mW and a maximum mean transmission time of
1%.  </t>


<t>The format of the uplink frame is the following:</t>

<t>The main radio characteristics of the UNB downlink transmission are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

  <t>Channelization mask: 1.5 kHz</t>
  <t>Downlink baud rate: 600 baud</t>
  <t>Modulation scheme: GFSK</t>

<t>In Europe, the UNB downlink frequency band is limited to 869,40 to 869,65
MHz, with a maximum output power of 500 mW  with 10% duty cycle.  </t>

</list></t>

<t> The radio interface is optimized for uplink transmissions, which are
asynchronous. Downlink communications are achieved by querying the network for
existing data from the device.  </t>

<t> A device willing to receive downlink messages opens a fixed window for
reception after sending an uplink transmission.  The delay and duration of this
window have fixed values. The LTN network transmits the downlink message for a
given device during the reception window. The LTN network selects the BS for
transmitting the corresponding downlink message.  </t>

<t> Uplink and downlink transmissions are unbalanced due to the regulatory
constraints on the ISM bands. Under the strictest regulations, the system can
allow a maximum of 140 uplink messages and 4 downlink messages per device.
These restrictions can be slightly relaxed depending on system conditions and
the specific regulatory domain of operation. </t>

<t> <xref target="sigfox-arch" /> depicts the different elements of the SIGFOX
architecture.  </t>

<t> The architecture consists of a single core network, which allows global
connectivity with minimal impact on the end device and radio access network.
The core network elements are the Service Center (SC) and the Registration
Authority (RA). The SC is in charge of the data connectivity between the Base
Station (BS) and the Internet, as well as the control and management of the BSs
and End Points.  The RA is in charge of the End Point network access
authorization.</t>

<t> The radio access network is comprised of several BSs connected directly to
the SC. Each BS performs complex L1/L2 functions, leaving some L2 and L3
functionalities to the SC.</t>

<t> The devices or End Points (EPs) are the objects that communicate
application data between local device applications (DAs) and network
applications (NAs).</t>

<t> EPs (or devices) can be static or nomadic, as they associate with the SC
and they do not attach to a specific BS. Hence, they can communicate with the
SC through one or many BSs.</t>

<t> Due to constraints in the complexity of the EP, it is assumed that EPs host
only one or very few device applications, which communicate to one single
network application at a time.</t>     

<t> The radio protocol provides mechanisms to authenticate and ensure integrity
of the message. This is achieved by using a unique device ID and a message
authentication code, which allow ensuring that the message has been generated
and sent by the device with the ID claimed in the message. </t>

<t> Security keys are independent for each device. These keys are associated
with the device ID and they are pre-provisioned. Application data can be
encrypted by the application provider.  </t>
