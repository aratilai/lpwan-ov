   <abstract>

	  <t>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies
with 
characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly 
very small packet and
application layer data sizes and long battery life operation.  
This memo is an
informational overview of the set of LPWAN technologies being 
considered in the IETF and of the gaps that exist between the
needs of those technologies and the goal of running IP in LPWANs.
