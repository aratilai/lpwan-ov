Abstract

   Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies with
   characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly
   very small packet and application layer data sizes and long battery
   life operation.  This memo is an informational overview of the set of
   LPWAN technologies being considered in the IETF and of the gaps that
   exist between the needs of those technologies and the goal of running
   IP in LPWANs.

1.  Introduction

   [[Editor comments/queries are in double square brackets like this.]]

   This document provides background material and an overview of the
   technologies being considered in the IETF's Low Power Wide-Area
   Networking (LPWAN) working group.  We also provide a gap analysis
   between the needs of these technologies and currently available IETF
   specifications.

   This document is largely the work of the people listed in Section 8.
   Discussion of this document should take place on the lpwan@ietf.org
   list.

   [[Editor's note: the eventual fate of this draft is a topic for the
   WG to consider - it might end up as a useful RFC, or it might be best
   maintained as a draft only until its utility has dissapated.  FWIW,
   the editor doesn't mind what outcome the WG choose.]]

2.  Terminology

   [[Not sure if 2119 terms will be needed.  Leave it here for now.]]
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   [[Extract common terms here.  Maybe define and relate technology
   specific terms, e.g. lora g/w similar to sigfox bs etc.  There is
   text for this in the current "gaps" draft.]]

3.  Common Concerns

   [[Editors note: We may want a section like this that describes some
   cross-cutting issues, e.g. duty-cycles, some of the ISM band
   restrictions.  This isn't intended to be a problem statement nor a
   set of requirements but just to describe some issues that affect more
   than one of the LPWAN technologies.  Such a section might be better
   before or after Section 4, will see when text's added there.  There
   is some text for this in the current "gaps" draft.]]

   [[Maybe add text about the common/different goals, eg.  NB-IoT has
   "improved indoor coverage" which is different, all have "low power
   consumption."  If so, that'd start to look like Table 1.  It may make
   more sense to eliminate rows of this table that are all "Y" entries
   and just say those are common goals in text or another table.]]

4.  LPWAN Technologies

   This section provides an overview of the set of LPWAN technologies
   that are being considered in the LPWAN working group.  The text for
   each was mainly contributed by the proponents of each technology.

   Note that this text is not intended to be normative in any sesne, but
   simply to help the reader in finding the relevant layer 2
   specifications and in understanding how those integrate with IETF-
   defined technologies.  Similarly, there is no attempt here to set out
   the pros and cons of the relevant technologies.  [[Editor: I assume
   that's the right target here.  Please comment if you disagree.]]

   [[Editor's note: the goal here is 2-3 pages per technology.  If
   there's much more needed then we could add appendices I guess
   depending on what text the WG find useful to include.]]

4.1.  LoRaWAN

   [[Text TBD, I-D co-authored by the editor of this document and Alper
   is planned to be published Wed Oct 26]]

4.2.  Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)

   [[Text here is from [I-D.ratilainen-lpwan-nb-iot].]]

4.2.1.  Provenance and Documents

   Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is developed and standardized
   by 3GPP.  The standardization of NB-IoT was finalized with 3GPP
   Release-13 in June 2016, but further enhancements for NB-IoT are
   worked on in the following releases, for example in the form of
   multicast support.  For more information of what has been specified
   for NB-IoT, 3GPP specification 36.300 [TGPP36300] provides an
   overview and overall description of the E-UTRAN radio interface
   protocol architecture, while specifications 36.321 [TGPP36321],
   36.322 [TGPP36322], 36.323 [TGPP36323] and 36.331 [TGPP36331] give
   more detailed description of MAC, RLC, PDCP and RRC protocol layers
   respectively.  The new versions of the specifications including NB-
   IoT are not yet available due to novelty of the feature, but should
   be shortly available in the 3GPP website.

4.2.2.  Characteristics

   [[Editor notes: Not clear if all the radio info here is needed.  Not
   clear what MTUs might be.  Many 3GPP acronyms/terms to eliminate or
   explain.]]

   Specific targets for NB-IoT include: Less than 5$ module cost,
   extended coverage of 164 dB maximum coupling loss, battery life of
   over 10 years, ~55000 devices per cell and uplink reporting latency
   of less than 10 seconds.

   NB-IoT supports Half Duplex FDD operation mode with 60 kbps peak rate
   in uplink and 30 kbps peak rate in downlink.  As the name suggests,
   NB-IoT uses narrowbands with the bandwidth of 180 kHz in both,
   downlink and uplink.  The multiple access scheme used in the downlink
   is OFDMA with 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing.  On uplink multi-tone SC-
   FDMA is used with 15 kHz tone spacing or as a special case of SC-FDMA
   single tone with either 15kHz or 3.75 kHz tone spacing may be used.

   NB-IoT can be deployed in three ways.  In-band deployment means that
   the narrowband is multiplexed within normal LTE carrier.  In Guard-
   band deployment the narrowband uses the unused resource blocks
   between two adjacent LTE carriers.  Also standalone deployment is
   supported, where the narrowband can be located alone in dedicated
   spectrum, which makes it possible for example to refarm the GSM
   carrier at 850/900 MHz for NB-IoT.  All three deployment modes are
   meant to be used in licensed bands.  The maximum transmission power
   is either 20 or 23 dBm for uplink transmissions, while for downlink
   transmission the eNodeB may use higher transmission power, up to 46
   dBm depending on the deployment.

   For signaling optimization, two options are introduced in addition to
   legacy RRC connection setup, mandatory Data-over-NAS (Control Plane
   optimization, solution 2 in [TGPP23720]) and optional RRC Suspend/
   Resume (User Plane optimization, solution 18 in [TGPP23720]).  In the
   control plane optimization the data is sent over Non Access Stratum,
   directly from Mobility Management Entity (MME) in core network to the
   UE without interaction from base station.  This means there are no
   Access Stratum security or header compression, as the Access Stratum
   is bypassed, and only limited RRC procedures.

   The RRC Suspend/Resume procedures reduce the signaling overhead
   required for UE state transition from Idle to Connected mode in order
   to have a user plane transaction with the network and back to Idle
   state by reducing the signaling messages required compared to legacy
   operation

   With extended DRX the RRC Connected mode DRX cycle is up to 10.24
   seconds and in RRC Idle the DRX cycle can be up to 3 hours.

   NB-IoT has no channel access restrictions allowing up to a 100% duty-
   cycle.

   3GPP access security is specified in [TGPP33203].

   Mobility Management Entity (MME) is responsible for handling the
   mobility of the UE.  MME tasks include tracking and paging UEs,
   session management, choosing the Serving gateway for the UE during
   initial attachment and authenticating the user.  At MME, the Non
   Access Stratum (NAS) signaling from the UE is terminated.

   Serving Gateway (S-GW) routes and forwards the user data packets
   through the access network and acts as a mobility anchor for UEs
   during handover between base stations known as eNodeBs and also
   during handovers between other 3GPP technologies.

   Packet Data Node Gateway (P-GW) works as an interface between 3GPP
   network and external networks.

   Home Subscriber Server (HSS) contains user-related and subscription-
   related information.  It is a database, which performs mobility
   management, session establishment support, user authentication and
   access authorization.

   E-UTRAN consists of components of a single type, eNodeB. eNodeB is a
   base station, which controls the UEs in one or several cells.

   The illustration of 3GPP radio protocol architecture can be seen from
   Figure 2.

                Figure 2: 3GPP radio protocol architecture

   The radio protocol architecture of NB-IoT (and LTE) is separated into
   control plane and user plane.  Control plane consists of protocols
   which control the radio access bearers and the connection between the
   UE and the network.  The highest layer of control plane is called
   Non-Access Stratum (NAS), which conveys the radio signaling between
   the UE and the EPC, passing transparently through radio network.  It
   is responsible for authentication, security control, mobility
   management and bearer management.

   Access Stratum (AS) is the functional layer below NAS, and in control
   plane it consists of Radio Resource Control protocol (RRC)
   [TGPP36331], which handles connection establishment and release
   functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer
   establishment, reconfiguration and release.  RRC configures the user
   and control planes according to the network status.  There exists two
   RRC states, RRC_Idle or RRC_Connected, and RRC entity controls the
   switching between these states.  In RRC_Idle, the network knows that
   the UE is present in the network and the UE can be reached in case of
   incoming call.  In this state the UE monitors paging, performs cell
   measurements and cell selection and acquires system information.
   Also the UE can receive broadcast and multicast data, but it is not
   expected to transmit or receive singlecast data.  In RRC_Connected
   the UE has a connection to the eNodeB, the network knows the UE
   location on cell level and the UE may receive and transmit singlecast
   data.  RRC_Connected mode is established, when the UE is expected to
   be active in the network, to transmit or receive data.  Connection is
   released, switching to RRC_Idle, when there is no traffic to save the
   UE battery and radio resources.  However, a new feature was
   introduced for NB-IoT, as mentioned earlier, which allows data to be

   transmitted from the MME directly to the UE, while the UE is in
   RRC_Idle transparently to the eNodeB.

   Packet Data Convergence Protocol's (PDCP) [TGPP36323] main services
   in control plane are transfer of control plane data, ciphering and
   integrity protection.

   Radio Link Control protocol (RLC) [TGPP36322] performs transfer of
   upper layer PDUs and optionally error correction with Automatic
   Repeat reQuest (ARQ), concatenation, segmentation and reassembly of
   RLC SDUs, in-sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs, duplicate
   detection, RLC SDU discard, RLC-re-establishment and protocol error
   detection and recovery.

   Medium Access Control protocol (MAC) [TGPP36321] provides mapping
   between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing of MAC
   SDUs, scheduling information reporting, error correction with HARQ,
   priority handling and transport format selection.

   Physical layer [TGPP36201] provides data transport services to higher
   layers.  These include error detection and indication to higher
   layers, FEC encoding, HARQ soft-combining.  Rate matching and mapping
   of the transport channels onto physical channels, power weighting and
   modulation of physical channels, frequency and time synchronization
   and radio characteristics measurements.

   User plane is responsible for transferring the user data through the
   Access Stratum.  It interfaces with IP and consists of PDCP, which in
   user plane performs header compression using Robust Header
   Compression (RoHC), transfer of user plane data between eNodeB and
   UE, ciphering and integrity protection.  Lower layers in user plane
   are similarly RLC, MAC and physical layer performing tasks mentioned
   above.

   Under worst-case conditions, NB-IoT may achieve data rate of roughly
   200 bps.  For downlink with 164 dB coupling loss, NB-IoT may achieve
   higher data rates, depending on the deployment mode.  Stand-alone
   operation may achieve the highest data rates, up to few kbps, while
   in-band and guard-band operations may reach several hundreds of bps.
   NB-IoT may even operate with higher maximum coupling loss than 170 dB
   with very low bit rates.

4.3.  SIGFOX

4.3.1.  Provenance and Documents

   The SIGFOX LPWAN is in line with the terminology and specifications
   being defined by the ETSI ERM TG28 Low Throughput Networks (LTN)
   group [etsi_ltn].  As of today, the SIGFOX LPWAN/LTN has been fully
   deployed in 6 countries, with ongoing deployments on 14 other
   countries, which in total will reach 316M people.

4.3.2.  Characteristics

   SIGFOX LPWAN autonomous battery-operated devices send only a few
   bytes per day, week or month, allowing them to remain on a single
   battery for up to 10-15 years.

   The radio interface is compliant with the following regulations:

      Spectrum allocation in the USA [fcc_ref],

      Spectrum allocation in Europe [etsi_ref],

      Spectrum allocation in Japan [arib_ref].

   The SIGFOX LTN radio interface is also compliant with the local
   regulations of the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada,
   Kenya, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Peru,
   Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Thailand.

   The radio interface is based on Ultra Narrow Band (UNB)
   communications, which allow an increased transmission range by
   spending a limited amount of energy at the device.  Moreover, UNB
   allows a large number of devices to coexist in a given cell without
   significantly increasing the spectrum interference.

   Both uplink and downlink communications are possible with the UNB
   solution.  Due to spectrum optimizations, different uplink and
   downlink frames and time synchronization methods are needed.

   The main radio characteristics of the UNB uplink transmission are:

   o  Channelization mask: 100 Hz (600 Hz in the USA)

   o  Uplink baud rate: 100 baud (600 baud in the USA)

   o  Modulation scheme: DBPSK

   o  Uplink transmission power: compliant with local regulation

   o  Link budget: 155 dB (or better)

Internet-Draft   Low Power Wide Area Networking Overview    October 2016


   o  Central frequency accuracy: not relevant, provided there is no
      significant frequency drift within an uplink packet

   In Europe, the UNB uplink frequency band is limited to 868,00 to
   868,60 MHz, with a maximum output power of 25 mW and a maximum mean
   transmission time of 1%.

   The format of the uplink frame is the following:

   In Europe, the UNB downlink frequency band is limited to 869,40 to
   869,65 MHz, with a maximum output power of 500 mW with 10% duty
   cycle.

   The format of the downlink frame is the following:

   +------------+-----+---------+------------------+-------------+-----+
   |  Preamble  |Frame|   ECC   |     Payload      |Msg Auth Code| FCS |
   |            |Sync |         |                  |             |     |

                      Figure 4: Downlink Frame Format

   The downlink frame is composed of the following fields:

   o  Preamble: 91 bits

   o  Frame sync and header: 13 bits

   o  Error Correcting Code (ECC): 32 bits

   o  Payload: 0-64 bits

   o  Authentication: 16 bits

   o  Frame check sequence: 8 bits (CRC)

   The radio interface is optimized for uplink transmissions, which are
   asynchronous.  Downlink communications are achieved by querying the
   network for existing data from the device.

   A device willing to receive downlink messages opens a fixed window
   for reception after sending an uplink transmission.  The delay and
   duration of this window have fixed values.  The LTN network transmits
   the downlink message for a given device during the reception window.
   The LTN network selects the BS for transmitting the corresponding
   downlink message.

   Uplink and downlink transmissions are unbalanced due to the
   regulatory constraints on the ISM bands.  Under the strictest
   regulations, the system can allow a maximum of 140 uplink messages
   and 4 downlink messages per device.  These restrictions can be
   slightly relaxed depending on system conditions and the specific
   regulatory domain of operation.

                      Figure 5: ETSI LTN architecture

   Figure 5 depicts the different elements of the SIGFOX architecture.

   The architecture consists of a single core network, which allows
   global connectivity with minimal impact on the end device and radio
   access network.  The core network elements are the Service Center
   (SC) and the Registration Authority (RA).  The SC is in charge of the
   data connectivity between the Base Station (BS) and the Internet, as
   well as the control and management of the BSs and End Points.  The RA
   is in charge of the End Point network access authorization.

   The radio access network is comprised of several BSs connected
   directly to the SC.  Each BS performs complex L1/L2 functions,
   leaving some L2 and L3 functionalities to the SC.

   The devices or End Points (EPs) are the objects that communicate
   application data between local device applications (DAs) and network
   applications (NAs).

   EPs (or devices) can be static or nomadic, as they associate with the
   SC and they do not attach to a specific BS.  Hence, they can
   communicate with the SC through one or many BSs.

   Due to constraints in the complexity of the EP, it is assumed that
   EPs host only one or very few device applications, which communicate
   to one single network application at a time.

   The radio protocol provides mechanisms to authenticate and ensure
   integrity of the message.  This is achieved by using a unique device
   ID and a message authentication code, which allow ensuring that the
   message has been generated and sent by the device with the ID claimed
   in the message.

   Security keys are independent for each device.  These keys are
   associated with the device ID and they are pre-provisioned.
   Application data can be encrypted by the application provider.
